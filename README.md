# Bare Bones

This is like a starter template when creating a website.

What's Included?

- index.html
	- basic html structure with Google Analytics tracking base code
	- normalize CDN link
- css
	- sass
	  - main.sass

- js

If you prefer to use Sass, there's a separate folder within the CSS folder.

Note: The img and js folders are missing because they're empty. Just be sure to create these folders within your own project.
